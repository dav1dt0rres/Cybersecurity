o a central management system, where the wireless IDS data is stored and processed. Decentralized wireless intrusion detection usually includes one or more devices that perform both the data gathering and processing/reporting functions of the IDS. The decentralized method is best suited for smaller (1-2 WAP) WLANs due to cost and management issues. The cost of sensors with data processing capability can become prohibitive when many sensors are required. Also, management of multiple processing/reporting sensors can be more time intensive than in a centralized model.


Suppose policy states that all wireless communications must be encrypted. A wireless IDS can continually monitor the 802.11 communications and if a WAP or other 802.11 device is detected communicating without encryption, the IDS will detect and notify on the activity. If the wireless IDS is pre-configured with all the authorized WAPs and an unknown (rogue) WAP is introduced to the area, the IDS will promptly identify
